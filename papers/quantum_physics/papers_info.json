Though the time\nscale for broad practical impact of quantum computation is still uncertain, in\nthe near future we can expect noteworthy progress toward scalable\nfault-tolerant quantum computing, and discoveries enabled by programmable\nquantum simulators. In the longer term, controlling highly complex quantum\nmatter will open the door to profound scientific advances and powerful new\ntechnologies.",

In fact, our studies\nare consistent with current theories and physical factual experiments, e.g.,\nrelevant to hydrogen atom physics experiments. Using the new universal\nuncertainty principle, people can give all applications to atomic physics,\nquantum mechanics, quantum communication, quantum calculations, quantum\ncomputer and so on.",
